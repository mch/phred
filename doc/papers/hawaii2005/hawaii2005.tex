\section{Introduction}
The discovery of enhanced optical transmission by Ebessen
et al. \cite{ebessen1998} in 1998 has  to a large amount of
experimental and theoretical work on te



\section{Parallel Methods}


\section{Optical Simulation}
Devaus and Ebbesen has reported that a laser focused on one array of
nano-holes can couple into surface plasmon modes, which travel along
the surface of the metal to a second array of holes, where the surface
plasmon modes are coupled back into propagating modes \cite{devaux2003}.

In order to explore this effect with FDTD, it is necessary to have
an extremly large grid, due to the size of the arrays and the space
between them. This problem cannot be analysed used periodic boundary
conditions, although it does posses one plane of symmetry.
