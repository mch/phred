Benchmarks for test MPI performance, bandwidth and latency in
particular

Intesting XD1 Tests: http://www.csm.ornl.gov/~dunigan/xd1/

* mpi-simple
Transfer of contiguous memory

* mpi-derived
Transfer of planes of memory in a 3d cube like in the FDTD code using
MPI derived datatypes. Not surprisingly, the contiguous transfer is
faster than the non-contiguous transfers. 

* mpi-manual
Transfer of planes of memory in a 3d cube like in the FDTD code using
manual pack/unpack of the data into buffers.
