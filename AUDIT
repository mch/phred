CODE AUDIT PLAN
---------------

Phred needs an audit to check for a number of important issues that
may have been overlooked or missed during initial development. This
is a list of things to look for when auditing. 

Some kind of design document should be constructed to detail the
overall layout of Phred and how it operates (or is supposed to
operate). That can also serve as the specification to build unit
tests from, so that the code can be verified as working correctly.
