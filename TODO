TODO LIST FOR PHRED

* Various

- Overloaded operator<< for objects which need to print out a
  representation

- Have a generic object that represents configuration, with a
  map<string, Varient> where Varient stores type information and
  data. Boost has a variant.

* Sanity
Sanity checks required:

- Ensure excitations apply to some cell in the grid

- Ensure excitations do not overlap boundaries


* Checkpoints

* Save/load problem description in a text file 

* Test cases!!
Unit tests are looking more and more useful, as small changes break
old things all over the place.

- Roast? http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~dhoffman/roast1.2/docs/manual/index.html

* Results

- Fix PlaneResult so that it takes coordinates in terms of real space
  instead of grid cells

- Fix GridResult and BlockResult so that a subset of the grid defined
  by a CSGBox can be returned, rather than the entire grid.
