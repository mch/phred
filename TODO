TODO LIST FOR PHRED

* Sanity
Sanity checks required:

** Ensure excitations apply to some cell in the grid

** Ensure excitations do not overlap boundaries


* Checkpoints

* Save/load problem description in a text file 

* Test cases!!
Unit tests are looking more and more useful, as small changes break
old things all over the place.
