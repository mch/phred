NOTE ON LICENCES:
This program optionally depends on a number of other software
packages which are available under a variety of licences. This affects
what licences phred may be made availble under, which is currently
only the GPL, but it could be made availble under other licences by
request. These are:

popt (command line option parsing), Lesser GNU Public Licence

netCDF (data file output), unknown

HDF (data file output), unknown

LAM/MPI (Message passing), under a special license which is probably
GPL compadible. 

MPICH (Message passing), under a special license which is probably
GPL compadible. 

Python, 

readline, GPL

Boost, Boost licence, GPL compadible AFAIK

THINGS TO DO:
There's a bunch of stuff that needs to be done, with respect to the
code organization and with respect to the FDTD itself. 

Some more though needs to go into the life cycle management of the
objects, who creates them, who owns them, how and when they are
destroyed, when they are considered "locked", and so on. Code clean up
and consistency checks are required. 

Parallel stuff:
- MPI fixups
- OpenMP
- AltiVec
- SSE2

FDTD stuff:
- Near to far field transformation
- Total scattered field formulation
